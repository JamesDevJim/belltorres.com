# Family Story (appears on About page)
family_story: |
  We're the Bell-Torres family, living our best life in sunny San Diego, California. Our story is one of adventure, passion, and continuous growth.
  
  James and Namibia met through their shared love of adventure and complementary passions - his analytical mind and her creative spirit creating the perfect balance. Together, we've built a life filled with meaningful work, exciting hobbies, and the kind of love that makes every day an adventure.
  
  Dax joined our family as a puppy and immediately claimed his spot as the heart of our home. His unconditional love and boundless enthusiasm remind us daily to find joy in the simple things - a good walk, a warm sunny spot, or quality time with the people you love.
  
  Now, as we prepare to welcome our first child, we're embarking on our greatest adventure yet. This website is our way of documenting the journey - the travels, the hobbies, the everyday moments that make life meaningful, and the big milestones that take our breath away.
  
  Thanks for stopping by our little corner of the internet. We hope our stories inspire you to embrace your own adventures, pursue your passions, and cherish the people (and pets!) who make life worth living.
