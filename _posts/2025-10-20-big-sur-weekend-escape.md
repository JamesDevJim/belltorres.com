If you've never driven Highway 1 along California's central coast, add it to your bucket list immediately. Last weekend, we packed up the car with Dax in the back seat (his favorite spot where he can stick his head out the window) and headed north to Big Sur for a long weekend of coastal beauty and redwood forests.

## The Drive

The journey up the coast is half the adventure. We left San Diego early Saturday morning, stopped for coffee in San Luis Obispo (James insisted on visiting a local roaster he'd been researching—typical!), and arrived at our campsite just as the afternoon light was hitting the cliffs at just the right angle.

Dax was beside himself with excitement. This was his first time seeing such towering trees, and watching him discover the redwoods was pure joy. He'd look up, then look at us as if to say, "Are you SEEING this??"

## Highlights from the Trip

### Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park

Sunday morning we hiked to McWay Falls—that famous waterfall that drops right onto the beach. The trail is short but stunning, and the views are absolutely breathtaking. We timed it for early morning to beat the crowds, and it was worth dragging ourselves out of our sleeping bags at dawn.

Dax, being Dax, was more interested in all the new smells than the spectacular scenery, but he posed for a family photo at the overlook like the good boy he is.

### Camping Under the Stars

One of the best parts of the trip was spending evenings at our campsite. We'd cook dinner on our camp stove (Namibia's campfire cooking skills are seriously impressive), and then just sit and stare at the stars. The lack of light pollution made the Milky Way clearly visible—something you just can't get in the city.

James tried to take astrophotography shots with his phone, with mixed results. Turns out professional astrophotographers use expensive equipment for a reason. Who knew?

### The Food

We ate incredibly well on this trip. We stopped at Nepenthe for lunch on our last day—the views from their deck are unreal—and had breakfast at Big Sur Bakery (get there early!). But honestly, some of our best meals were the simple ones we cooked at camp: eggs and coffee in the morning, sandwiches for lunch, and whatever we could throw together on the camp stove for dinner.

There's something about eating outside with an ocean breeze and the sound of waves in the background that makes even the simplest food taste amazing.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Book campsites WAY in advance.** Big Sur is popular for a reason, and sites fill up months ahead.

2. **Bring layers.** The coast can go from warm and sunny to chilly and foggy in minutes. We learned this the hard way.

3. **Dax-proof your campsite.** Our curious pup got into our food bag on the first night. Lesson learned: everything goes in the bear box, even if there are no bears around.

4. **Take your time.** We originally planned to do way more hiking, but we ended up just savoring the moments—sitting by the campfire, taking short walks, reading books in our camp chairs. Sometimes the best travel is the kind where you just slow down and be present.

## What's Next?

This trip has us itching for more California camping adventures. We're already talking about Yosemite in the spring, Joshua Tree in the winter, and maybe a trip up to the Sierras. And of course, Dax is already packed and ready for the next adventure.

For anyone planning a Big Sur trip: do it. The drive is unforgettable, the camping is incredible, and there's something about this stretch of coast that feels almost magical. Just remember to bring layers, book ahead, and be prepared to have your breath taken away.
